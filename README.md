## Building and Running Docker Image

To build the Docker image and run a container using the image, follow these steps:

1. Make sure Docker is installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt.
5. Build the Docker image using the following command:
6. Once the image is built successfully, run a container using the following command:
7. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the application running inside the Docker container.

## Assumptions and Decisions

During the development process, the following assumptions and decisions were made:

1. **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were chosen for simplicity and ease of implementation.
2. **Styling**: Minimal styling was applied to keep the focus on functionality.
3. **Functionality**: The application provides basic features for adding, viewing, and marking tasks as completed.
4. **No Backend**: This is a frontend-only application; no backend or database integration is included.
5. **Port Configuration**: The application runs on port 80 inside the Docker container and is exposed on port 8080 on the host machine.
